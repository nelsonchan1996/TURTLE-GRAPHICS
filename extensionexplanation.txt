In my extension, I created four new INSTRUCTIONs for the turtle program,
including HOME, MOVE, DIREC and COLOR. I will briefly explain each and present
their grammar structures as follows.
The first instruction I created is called HOME. What it does is just reset the
turtle to its original position. Its structure should be like:
<HOME> ::= "HOME"
The second instruction I created is called MOVE. What it does is move the
turtle to any position the user likes. The position is defined by two
numbers, each representing the x value or y value of the specific point on
the screen. Its structure should be like:
<MOVE> ::= "MOVE" number number
The third instruction I created is called DIREC. What it does is set
the moving direction of the turtle by changing the previous angle stored in
the structure. It contains four elements: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT'.
It can be put in any where in the turtle program to change the direction.
<DIREC> ::= "UP" | "DOWN" | "LEFT" | "RIGHT"
The fourth instruction I created is called COLOR. With this instruction, the
user can pick from 5 basic colors for the drawing, including red, yellow, blue,
green, white, just by putting the name of colors after "COLOR".
<COLOR> ::= "RED" | "YELLOW" | "BLUE" | "GREEN" | "WHITE"
The fifth instruction I created is called ELEPH. Each time this instruction
is called, it automatically draws an elephant on the screen. Its grammar
structure contains a number which represents the size of the elephant drawn.
<ELEPH> ::= "ELEPH" number

The Formal Grammar after new instructions added should be like:
<MAIN> ::= "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<INSTRCTLST> ::= <INSTRUCTION><INSTRCTLST> |
"}"
<INSTRUCTION> ::= <FD> |
<LT> |
<RT> |
<DO> |
<SET>|
<HOME>|
<MOVE>|
<DIREC>|
<COLOR>|
<ELEPH>
<FD> ::= "FD" <VARNUM>
<LT> ::= "LT" <VARNUM>
<RT> ::= "RT" <VARNUM>
<DO> ::= "DO" <VAR> "FROM" <VARNUM> "TO"
<VARNUM> "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<VAR> ::= [A−Z]
<VARNUM> ::= number | <VAR>
<SET> ::= "SET" <VAR> ":=" <POLISH>
<POLISH> ::= <OP> <POLISH> | <VARNUM> <POLISH> | ";"
<OP> ::= "+" | "−" | "*" | "/"
<HOME> ::= "HOME"
<MOVE> ::= "MOVE" number number
<DIREC> ::= "UP" | "DOWN" | "LEFT" | "RIGHT"
<COLOR> ::= "RED" | "YELLOW" | "BLUE" | "GREEN" | "WHITE"
<ELEPH> ::= "ELEPH" number
